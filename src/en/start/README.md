# Start

Welcome to Ballex² mapping tutorial!

## How to Read

This tutorial now consists of three sections: start, advanced and cookbook.

### Start

The start section is intended for those who are new to mapping, and will introduce all the basic functions and operations of BME Pro. The chapters in this section are arranged in the order of the mapping process, plus the order in which I prefer to explain them.

Here're some reading suggestions:

- This section doesn't presuppose that the reader has relevant experience and expertise, but you do need to have a grasp of computer operations, as well as some basic (perhaps high school level) math and physics
- Actually, every chapter here is important, so please try not to skip one
- Due to lack of systematic nature of this tutorial, distinctive style of my writing and drainage of my energy, I can't provide examples that can be imitated / followed step by step. But I highly recommend that you read the tutorial with BME Pro on, fiddle around with it, and try to summarize its mechanics yourself
- Creating a highly completed map requires a combination of most of the knowledges explained in this section. When you finish reading a chapter, try to combine what you have already learned (or even understood in advance) and see what you can do with them
- After learning everything in this section, you will be able to replicate most of the layouts in official levels

### Advanced

The advanced section is intended for those who are already proficient with the basic features, and will show the advanced features in BME Pro. The chapters in this section are not sequential, and are largely independent of each other, with references to the corresponding sections if something relies on other features.

Here're some reading suggestions:

- This section will follow the style of a technical documentation, and will presuppose that the reader has fully mastered all the contents in the start section, as well as the expertise related to each chapter
- You can skim this section to get a quick overview of features and potential of BME Pro, or you can read only the sections which correspond to your actual needs
- This section will only show <u>what features BME Pro has and what each parameter does</u>, and won't explain <u>what features and parameters you'll need to use so as to achieve a certain goal</u>. Some common techniques will be explained in the cookbook section, but more uses need to be learned on your own
- The contents in this section are only the icing on the cake. If you want to make a better map, you should put more thought into the overall design, polish the details, and do your best to optimize the gameplay experience, rather than introducing fancy and irrelevant mechanics and elements
- After learning everything in this section, you will be able to beat Mushreb

### Cookbook

The cookbook section will give recommended steps and solutions for specific aspects and cases. The chapters in this section are not sequential, and are independent of each other.

Here're some reading suggestions:

- This section is similar to a section of problem set solutions, so choose your most accustomed way to read them ~~Who reads the teaching aids?~~
- After learning everything in this section, you won't be able to cook Mushreb
